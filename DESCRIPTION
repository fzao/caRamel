Description: Multi-objective optimizer initially developed for the calibration of hydrological models.
     The algorithm is a hybrid of the MEAS algorithm (Efstratiadis and Koutsoyiannis (2005) <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.32963.81446>) by using the directional search method based on the simplexes of the objective space
     and the epsilon-NGSA-II algorithm with the method of classification of the parameter vectors archiving management by epsilon-dominance (Reed and Devireddy <doi:10.1142/9789812567796_0004>).
